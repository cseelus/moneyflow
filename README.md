## Code Style

- Prefer inferred types; avoid explicit type annotations unless necessary for clarity.
- We use Prettier with semi: false; semicolons should be omitted unless required by ASI rules.
- Use `npm run lint` to check for linting issues.
- Use `npm run format` to automatically format code.
- Pre-commit hooks will automatically format and lint your code before committing.
